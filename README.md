Developing the Southampton astronomy department website.

### Contributing

Ideally, fork the repository and clone that forked repository to your desktop. When you're ready to submit your code for use, click on Pull Requests->New Pull Request.

You can also submit straight to the repo if you're an owner, or just download the zipped up files.


### css information

Most of the relevant css code is found in **css/style.css**. This is where most of the section ids and classes are defined.

* #header defines the banner across the top
* #about defines the style for the main "about us" section on the front page
* #news_and_tweets defines the style for the section covering the twitter panel and latest news
* #counter and the associated classes defines the four panel counters for H-index, coffee machine etc. I haven't been able to get the animation working yet
* The "testimonial" section describes the "Selected Publications" portion of the home page
* #team section has a load of currently unused classes that can be used to create an icon for a staff member or student

There are also the usual bunch of headers (h1 etc).

The navbars and footers are all contained within **css/bootstrap.css**. I don't know what most of that file is.

**css/animate.css** contains a lot of css code ripped from Poshak's template. Again, I haven't got it to work but it should be used to get animations of the counters and slider working.

**css/slit_slider.css** contains some css for the original slider Poshak had on the site. I can't get this to work yet, so have a go.
